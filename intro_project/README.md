# Intro Project
- This program is a basic backend project which handles incoming HTTP requests(GET, POST, DELETE) and sends back responses using Node.js and Express.js.
  ## Running the Program:
  1. First open a new terminal window after opening the project in VSCode
  2. Change from the root directory into the intro_project directory
      ```
      cd intro_project
      ```
  3. Run the backend server
     ```
      npm run dev
     ```
  4. View the website and interact with it by opening a new browser window and typing in localhost:8383
  5. Test the endpoints by running the tests in the test.rest file by pressing the send request over the various tests. <br> The POST request and DELETE requests will update the website at localhost:8383.
